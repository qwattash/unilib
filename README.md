A test project that I used to experiment on MVC patterns, it is done in javascript not because I like it particularly but because the project has been realised within an university assignment.

As said the primary goal of the project is to be an experiment on MVC patterns and a training to see the kind of problems that arise when developing a somehow bigger project. I focused mostly on identifying my errors and how they have propagated along the structure of the software rather than rewriting from scratch (university deadlines must be respected). The architecture is far from perfect but it might provide some hint to anyone willing to dig into it. The code should have jsDoc-compatible comments but there is some error when generating the documentation so I did not provide the documentation (debugging jsDoc errors is kind of a pain) but if someone request it I can make it work, justlet me know.
